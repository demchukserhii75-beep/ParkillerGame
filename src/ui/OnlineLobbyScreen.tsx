// Milestone 2 - reachable via the #online hash (see App.tsx), linked from StartScreen's "Jugar
// online" button once VITE_PHOTON_APP_ID is configured (see StartScreen.tsx's canPlayOnline gate).
// Verified against a real Photon App ID with two independent browser clients: room creation,
// joining, seat assignment, bot fill-in for empty seats, the game-start broadcast, and a live dice
// roll all relayed correctly and produced identical state on both sides.
//
// Reported directly, with a screenshot: this screen still looked like an unstyled dev tool (plain
// dark background, default HTML <select>/<input>, flat buttons) right next to a start screen and
// in-game HUD that had both since been restyled - same carved-wood card/button language ported
// here so the flow doesn't visibly change games partway through.

// Fixed Photon Realtime region - not exposed as a picker (see this file's own git history for the
// removed UI: it wasn't something the client ever asked for, and had no basis in the rulebook
// either, just an unrequested engineering nicety). The SDK's own "Best Region" ping-and-pick flow

// to read back. That's a real network round trip with a real race window - a joiner clicking in
// fast, or the host clicking "start" fast enough after seeing a joiner appear in the seat list,
// could read that property before it arrived, leaving an actually-connected human's seat looking
