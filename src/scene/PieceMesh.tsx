// Re-traced from a clean reference photo of classic parchís pawns (reported directly: the
// previous silhouette read as bulbous/hourglass-shaped, not a proper cone-and-ball pawn) - the
// previous profile's "waist" narrowed then flared back out almost to the base's own width before
// curving to a point, so the head swelled gradually out of the body instead of sitting as a
// distinct round ball. This one is a clean single taper (base -> neck, hand-placed, a real molded
// plastic base has straighter facets than a smooth curve) topped by a full sphere (neck -> pole,
// a true circular arc - center (0, 0.6766), radius 0.235 - sampled at even angles so it reads as
// round instead of faceted), with the ball's own widest point (its equator, at y=0.6766) narrower
// than the base (0.335 vs 0.335 raw... see PIECE_BASE_RADIUS note) so it reads as a ball sitting
// ON the cone rather than a continuation of it. The first two points are a flat bottom disc (as
// before) so the piece sits flush on the tile instead of balanced on a point.

// Bumped again, 0.078 -> 0.1, alongside BOARD_SIZE's own 12 -> 17: reported directly, again, with

//

//
// Bumped a seventh time, 0.13 -> 0.15, alongside BOARD_SIZE's own 24 -> 28 - reported directly,
// again, as still too small. A bigger jump than the previous six rounds' own ~8-10% increments,
// since six consecutive "still too small" reports in a row means those smaller steps clearly
// weren't closing the gap fast enough.
//
// Bumped an eighth time, 0.15 -> 0.17, alongside BOARD_SIZE's own 28 -> 32 - reported directly,
// again, as still too small.
//
// Bumped a ninth time, 0.17 -> 0.22, alongside BOARD_SIZE's own 32 -> 41 - reported directly,
// again, as too small to make out. A bigger jump than most previous rounds: the board's own
// on-screen size also just got genuinely smaller for the first time (the OrbitControls/far-plane
// bug that had been silently blocking every earlier "shrink the board" request - see
// CAMERA_DISTANCE's own comment - is now actually fixed), which on its own makes every piece read
// smaller on screen even without this change, on top of the standalone "still too small" report.
//
// Bumped a tenth time, 0.22 -> 0.28 - reported directly, again, as still too small. Nine
// consecutive "still too small" reports in a row (matching the seventh round's own reasoning for
// its bigger-than-usual step) calls for a decisively larger jump rather than another small nudge -
// checked directly against the tightest (6-player) board's own measured tile size (~1.478, so
// radius ~0.739) first: even at 0.28 a single piece still occupies well under half that tile
// radius, and the existing stacking clamp (BoardScene.tsx's own localStackOffset/MAX_OCCUPANT_RADIUS)
// scales with this constant automatically, so two pieces sharing a square still can't spill past
// their tile's own border regardless of how large this gets.
//
// Bumped an eleventh time, 0.28 -> 0.4 - reported directly, again, as still too small. Ten
// consecutive "still too small" reports in a row is well past the point where another 20-30%
// nudge is a reasonable bet - jumping to roughly 1.4x this time (54% of the tightest board's own
// tile radius, ~0.739, per the tenth round's own measurement) instead of the usual smaller step.
// Verified live, via a screenshot, on that same tightest (6-player) board with two pieces sharing
// one square (the actual worst case for overlap, not just a single idle piece) - both pieces are
// still clearly separated, not touching, so there's no need to also touch the stacking clamp itself.

// from here already for the exact same reason - its own PAWN_HEIGHT constant duplicates this

// Fixed regardless of how many squares a move covers - a previous version sped up per-hop
// duration for long reward moves so total playback wouldn't drag, but that meant two moves of
// different lengths visibly hopped at different speeds, reported directly as the animation being
// inconsistent ("sometimes smooth, sometimes zips along erratically"). Every hop, on every move,
// now takes exactly this long - a long reward move simply plays for longer in total, which is a
// smaller cost than the animation appearing to change speed depending on the roll.
// Reported directly ("말속도가 너무빠르므로 느리게 해달라 몇발자국이동했는지 가려볼수있게" - the
// piece speed is too fast, slow it down so it's possible to tell how many squares it moved,
// especially bots): 0.32 was tuned for a *readable* hop, but not necessarily a *countable* one at
// a glance, particularly for a bot's own moves where nothing else on screen forces the eye to slow
// down and count along. Bumped by half again - long reward moves (up to 20 squares) already play
// longer in total on purpose (see this constant's own comment above on why total playback time
// isn't held fixed), so a bigger per-hop cost here is a deliberate trade favoring "every hop is
// unambiguously its own beat" over overall turn brevity.

// keeping the same pace): HOP_DURATION (above) is exactly what sets that pace, and is deliberately
// untouched here - only the vertical arc itself is taller, not how long a hop takes. ParkillerMesh
// imports this same constant rather than duplicating its own, so the Parki's own hop grows taller
// right along with every pawn's.
//
// Bumped a second time ("O saltan un poco más" - or they jump a bit more), alongside adding
// hopSound.ts's own per-hop sound in this same round of feedback - same reasoning as the first
// bump, still untouched HOP_DURATION, just a bit more arc again.
export const BOUNCE_HEIGHT = 0.42 // world units, how high each hop arcs - a more emphatic, visible bounce

// Reported directly ("말이 이동할때 통통뛰게 해달라" - make the piece bounce springily when it
// moves): the existing hop was a plain sine arc - smooth up, smooth down, the piece's own shape
// never changing - which reads as gliding/floating rather than a genuine springy hop. Classic
// squash-and-stretch is what actually reads as "bouncy".
//
// First pass tied both squash and stretch directly to `bounce`/BOUNCE_HEIGHT (height above ground),
// so the piece was maximally *stretched* exactly at the arc's apex - the one instant it's moving
// slowest (vertical velocity is zero right at the peak). Reported directly as looking "흐물쩍"
// (floppy/rubbery) instead of springy: a real bounce stretches while moving fast (just after
// launch, just before landing) and squashes only in a brief instant at contact, not smoothly
// ballooning taller for the whole time it hangs near the top. Height-based timing put the biggest
// deformation exactly where a real object is closest to its resting shape, which reads as slow
// melting rather than a snap.
//
// Rebuilt on elapsed time `t` (0..1 across the hop) instead of height, as two blended pulses: a
// sharp `contactPulse` that's 1 exactly at t=0/1 (ground contact) and decays to 0 within
// HOP_SQUASH_WINDOW, giving a brief, snappy squash right at each landing/takeoff; and a gentler
// `stretchPulse` (plain sin(t*pi), suppressed by (1-contactPulse) so it never fights the squash
// window) that peaks at t=0.5 - a mild stretch through the fast-moving middle of the arc that's
// already fading in as the squash window ends, rather than a separate, disconnected bulge only at
// the very top.
//
// Magnitudes pulled in on the first pass here (to 0.85/1.1/1.1/0.95, down from an even earlier
// 0.8/1.22/1.14/0.92) alongside that timing fix - reported directly afterward as reading "딱딱하고
// 굳은것처럼" (stiff/rigid) instead of springy. The floppy complaint that motivated the timing
// rewrite was about *when* the deformation happened (stretching at the apex, the one instant a
// real object is moving slowest), not really about how big it was - now that squash is genuinely
// confined to the brief contact window and stretch to the fast-moving middle, a bigger swing reads
// as a energetic bounce rather than a melt, so pushed back out again, slightly past the original
// pre-timing-fix numbers this time given the explicit "still too stiff" feedback.

// Reported directly ("자기차례가 되여서 말을 이동할수있는말들을 시각적으로 알리게 효과를달라" - add a
