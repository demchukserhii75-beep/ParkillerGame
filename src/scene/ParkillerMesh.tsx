// matched to its own base radius) put the whole figure at roughly 2.3x a regular pawn's height -
// the model's own proportions are much more slender than a pawn's, so matching the footprint
// overscales the height. Matched to height instead - "clearly bigger than a pawn, not just

// total pawn height (raw profile height * PROFILE_SCALE * PIECE_HEIGHT_SCALE, imported live rather

  // turnaround) - every angle of that photo shows two distinct hands hanging separately at the
  // sides, roughly hip height. The first attempt to fix this guessed the arm's rotation.x/z by

  // off from "hanging down"), which read as short spikes jutting up near the shoulder rather
  // than arms reaching down to the hands - reported back as "looks like a scarecrow". This time
  // the rotation is computed, not guessed: pick a shoulder point (near the body's own surface at
  // shoulder height) and a hand point (at hip height, clearing the body's own flared radius
  // there, ~0.6-0.66 - see BODY_PROFILE_RAW), then derive the exact quaternion/Euler that points
  // the capsule's default +Y axis from one to the other (verified directly against three's own
  // Euler.setFromQuaternion, not hand-derived trig - a 2-angle-only derivation silently drops the
  // rotation.y component whenever the target direction doesn't lie exactly in the X-Z-free plane,
  // which is exactly what produced the wrong-by-150° result above).
  // Pushing the *whole arm* further out (position AND bigger hands together) was tried alongside a
  // wider hood flare and reverted for reading as a "blob" from a head-on yaw - see that same
  // comment on HOOD_PROFILE_RAW. The hand itself sat almost exactly on the body's own surface
  // radius at hip height (~0.6-0.66, see BODY_PROFILE_RAW), so with the hand's own ~0.17 radius on
  // top of that it was still 90% swallowed by the body mesh and barely readable as a hand at all
  // against the reference photo's own clearly separate, visible hand bump. Pushed out from 0.65 to
  // 0.78 (hand.position below) - enough to actually clear the body, deliberately short of the
  // previously-reverted magnitude.
  //
  // Split into two capsules (shoulder->elbow->hand) instead of one straight shoulder->hand capsule
  // - a bent elbow reads as a real arm, not a rigid rod. Reported directly, again, against the
  // parkiller.png turnaround sheet: the previous shoulder/elbow numbers read as two arms flung out
  // to the sides, not hanging at the sides - traced to the upper and lower capsule not actually
  // meeting at a shared elbow point. The previous shoulder was reconstructed as `2*oldCenter -
  // hand` from an even earlier single-capsule version, and the elbow was a separate "offset
  // outward+forward from the old straight-line path" guess - neither was ever checked against the
  // other, and they landed nowhere near each other (a ~0.4-unit gap, comparable to the whole arm's
  // own length): the upper capsule's own far end was already down at hip height while the lower
  // capsule's own near end started back up near mid-torso, so the two overlapped in the lower half
  // instead of chaining shoulder->elbow->hand, reading as a bulky clump reaching outward.
  //
  // Rebuilt from three explicit points instead - shoulder (near the body's own surface, ~y=1.65),
  // elbow (a modest outward bend, ~y=1.18), hand (hip height, ~y=0.82, clearing the body's own
  // flared radius there per BODY_PROFILE_RAW) - each capsule's position/rotation/length computed
  // directly from its own two endpoints via three's own Quaternion.setFromUnitVectors +
  // Euler.setFromQuaternion (not hand-derived trig), so the two segments are guaranteed to actually
  // meet at the elbow point instead of being independently guessed.
